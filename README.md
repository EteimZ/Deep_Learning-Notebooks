# Deep_Learning-Notebooks

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning which tries to mimic the human neural network in the form of artificial neural network.

This repo contains deep learning notebooks they are serve as reference. The deep learning libraries used in this repo is Pytorch & Tensorflow.

## Pytorch 

The folder contain pytorch codes.

* [Feed Forward Nueral Network](https://github.com/EteimZ/Deep_Learning-Notebooks/blob/main/Pytorch/feed_forward_nn.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/EteimZ/Deep_Learning-Notebooks/blob/main/Pytorch/feed_forward_nn.ipynb)

  This notebook demonstrates a simple [feed forward nueral network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network) on the MNIST dataset.
